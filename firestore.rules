/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Ye-Games application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides public read access to both `games` and `tags` collections.
 * Write access is completely disallowed for all users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The database contains two top-level collections: `/games/{gameId}` and `/tags/{tagId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access is granted to both collections, assuming the data is non-sensitive and intended for public consumption.
 * - Write access is completely denied to all users. To enable write access, update the rules to implement proper authorization logic.
